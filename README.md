# Support-Vector-Machine-SVM
Model Predicting on tumour type i.e. malignant or benign tumour

Based on the scikit-learn inbuild data sets, which have various data or the tumour predicting malignant or benign tumour.

Steps:
1) Importing necessary libraries.
2) Loading breast cancer dataset.
3) Splitting the dataset into training and testing.
4) Predicting using default parameter of SVC (Support Vector Classifier) and then looking at classification report and confusion matrix.
5) Evaluating best parameters that should be used using Grid Search.
6) Predicting the tumour type using best parameters.
7) Cuncluding the prediction by classification report and comfusion matrix

Thanks
